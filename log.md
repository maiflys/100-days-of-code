# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: First day. I had started Angela Yu's 2021 Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy at the beginning of the year, but only got about 10% through the course before stopping. I looked over some of the material and my old notes today to review so I can pick up again soon.

**Thoughts:** I need to create a more concrete schedule with the material I want to look over, but for now, I am glad to be getting back into learning. Based on my knowledge of habit setting, I will also edit this project more for my constraints by leting myself pass to the next day with only 30 minutes of study.
